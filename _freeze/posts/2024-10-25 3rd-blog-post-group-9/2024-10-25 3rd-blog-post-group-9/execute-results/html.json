We first removed rows with significant missing data\nto avoid skewing our results but kept those with minor gaps for further inspection. As part of exploratory data analysis (EDA), we \nchecked for unusual patterns, such as outliers, unexpectedly frequent or infrequent values, and relationships that align with or deviate\nfrom known trends. Below is an initial visualization showing the distribution of businesses by owner race and industry, helping us spot \npotential data inconsistencies or biases.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- readRDS(here::here(\"dataset/cleaned_data_N_revenue.rds\"))\ndata |>\n  filter(RACE_GROUP_LABEL != \"Total\",\n         NAICS2017_LABEL == \"Total for all sectors\",\n         SEX_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         ETH_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         VET_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         YEAR == 2017) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = RACE_GROUP_LABEL, y = FIRMPDEMP, fill = RACE_GROUP_LABEL), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  xlab(\"Major race for company\") +\n  ylab(\"Total amount of firms\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024-10-25-3rd-blog-post-group-9_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata |>\n  filter(RACE_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         NAICS2017_LABEL != \"Total for all sectors\",\n         SEX_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         ETH_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         VET_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         YEAR == 2017) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = NAICS2017_LABEL, y = FIRMPDEMP, fill = NAICS2017_LABEL), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  xlab(\"Major industry for company\") +\n  ylab(\"Total amount of firms\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024-10-25-3rd-blog-post-group-9_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nData Equity:\n\nThe first principle, justice, means treating everyone in our data fairly. If we're analyzing factors like race, gender, or income, we need to make sure our data \ncollection and analysis don’t favor one group over another. This ensures that all groups are represented equally, and the findings don’t carry any unfair bias. The \nsecond principle, respect for persons, focuses on people’s right to make their own choices. This means giving people the information they need to understand the \ndata and allowing them the freedom to act on it. If someone has limits, like age, a disability, or difficulty with language, they deserve extra support to \nunderstand and participate fully in the process.\n\nTransparency is key, but our analysis might have limitations. While the data from the U.S. Census Bureau and NCSES is comprehensive and diverse, it only covers 2017-\n2021, potentially missing recent trends. Though the dataset aims to be representative, some subgroups may still be underrepresented. Acknowledging these limitations \nensures responsible use and accurate insights into business growth, diversity, and resource needs.\n",
