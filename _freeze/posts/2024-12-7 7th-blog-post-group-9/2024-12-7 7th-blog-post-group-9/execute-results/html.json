Since we have not seen and analyzed \nthis important factors. \n\nThe tentative thesis we decided to choose is that the condition for the minority\ngroup and the groups needing more care from are not great through the years. \nThis could be discussed for several groups, including veteran groups and \nminority races, and from several aspects, including average income, \nemployment rate, and the current revenue of firms with more groups needing help,\nand the change of amount of new opening business by that group. Under this \nparagraph is a plot of change of average income through year. From here,\nthe condition doesn't seem so well for minority groups. Although the average\nincome for non-minority is having an increasing trend, it doesn't increase as \nmuch for minority and there sure needs something to be done. We have also made a \nplot for how the employees of each race have changed through year in blogpost 4,\nwhich doesn't seem so well for minority groups as well.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata |>\n  mutate(average_income = PAYANN / EMP * 1000) |>\n  filter(VET_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         NAICS2017_LABEL == \"Total for all sectors\",\n         ETH_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         SEX_LABEL == \"Total\") |>\n  subset(select = c(average_income, YEAR, RACE_GROUP_LABEL, YIBSZFI_LABEL)) |>\n  group_by(RACE_GROUP_LABEL) |>\n  filter(RACE_GROUP_LABEL %in% c(\"Nonminority\", \"Minority\", \"Equally minority/nonminority\")) |>\n  filter(YIBSZFI_LABEL %in% c(\"Firms with less than 2 years in business\", \"Firms with 16 or more years in business\",\"Firms with 4 to 5 years in business\")) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = YEAR, y = average_income, color = RACE_GROUP_LABEL, linetype = YIBSZFI_LABEL)) +\n  labs(color = 'Race category', \n       linetype = \"Years in business\") +\n  ylab(\"Average income / $\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024-12-7-7th-blog-post-group-9_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Plan to improve Visualizations:\n### Titles and Captions:\nUse descriptive titles that summarize the key insight of each graph (e.g., \"Trends in Average Employment by Racial Groups (2017–2021)\").\n\nAdd captions to provide context for each visualization, explaining the data source, key variables, and the main takeaway.\n\n### Annotations:\nHighlight key data points or trends with annotations. For example, mark significant peaks or declines in a line graph and explain them briefly (e.g., \"2017 Peak due to policy changes\").\n\n### Highlights:\nUse color schemes to emphasize important trends or categories. For instance, consistent colors for specific racial groups across all graphs will help in comparison.\n\nEmploy ggpubr functions like ggpar() to refine axis labels, text sizes, and legends for clarity.\n\n### Polished Designs:\nUtilize ggpubr for adding statistical comparisons (e.g., stat_compare_means()) to support data interpretation.\nAdd gridlines or adjust themes for better visual appeal using theme_pubr().\n\n## Tables:\n\n### Title and Context:\nInclude clear, bold titles for each table summarizing its content (e.g., \"Annual Payroll Trends Across Demographics (2017–2021)\").\n\nAdd concise footnotes explaining data sources or column definitions.\n\n### Formatting with GT:\nUse the gt package to format tables professionally. Features like grouping rows, adding summary rows, and highlighting columns can improve readability.\n\nAdd highlights for significant figures, such as changes in revenue or employment disparities.\n\n## Next Steps:\nApply a consistent style across all visualizations and tables, focusing on simplicity and accessibility.\n\nReview for alignment between visualizations and narrative, ensuring that every figure and table directly supports your analysis and conclusions.\n\nValidate design choices with peers or advisors for clarity and impact.\n",
