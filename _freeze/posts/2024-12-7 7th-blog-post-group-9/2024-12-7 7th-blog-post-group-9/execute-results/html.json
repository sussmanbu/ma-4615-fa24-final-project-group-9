Since we have not seen and analyzed \nthis important factors. \n\nThe tentative thesis we decided to choose is that the condition for the minority\ngroup and the groups needing more care from are not great through the years. \nThis could be discussed for several groups, including veteran groups and \nminority races, and from several aspects, including average income, \nemployment rate, and the current revenue of firms with more groups needing help,\nand the change of amount of new opening business by that group. Under this \nparagraph is a plot of change of average income through year. From here,\nthe condition doesn't seem so well for minority groups. Although the average\nincome for non-minority is having an increasing trend, it doesn't increase as \nmuch for minority and there sure needs something to be done. We have also made a \nplot for how the employees of each race have changed through year in blogpost 4,\nwhich doesn't seem so well for minority groups as well.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata |>\n  mutate(average_income = PAYANN / EMP * 1000) |>\n  filter(VET_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         NAICS2017_LABEL == \"Total for all sectors\",\n         ETH_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         SEX_LABEL == \"Total\") |>\n  subset(select = c(average_income, YEAR, RACE_GROUP_LABEL, YIBSZFI_LABEL)) |>\n  group_by(RACE_GROUP_LABEL) |>\n  filter(RACE_GROUP_LABEL %in% c(\"Nonminority\", \"Minority\", \"Equally minority/nonminority\")) |>\n  filter(YIBSZFI_LABEL %in% c(\"Firms with less than 2 years in business\", \"Firms with 16 or more years in business\",\"Firms with 4 to 5 years in business\")) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = YEAR, y = average_income, color = RACE_GROUP_LABEL, linetype = YIBSZFI_LABEL)) +\n  labs(color = 'Race category', \n       linetype = \"Years in business\") +\n  ylab(\"Average income / $\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024-12-7-7th-blog-post-group-9_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::",
