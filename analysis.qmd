This comes from the file `analysis.qmd`.

We describe here our detailed data analysis. This page will provide an overview of what questions you addressed, illustrations of relevant aspects of the data with tables and figures, and a statistical model that attempts to answer part of the question. You'll also reflect on next steps and further analysis.

The audience for this page is someone like your class mates, so you can expect that they have some level of statistical and quantitative sophistication and understand ideas like linear and logistic regression, coefficients, confidence intervals, overfitting, etc. 

While the exact number of figures and tables will vary and depend on your analysis, you should target around 5 to 6. An overly long analysis could lead to losing points.
If you want you can link back to your blog posts or create separate pages with more details.

The style of this paper should aim to be that of an academic paper. 
I don't expect this to be of publication quality but you should keep that aim in mind.
Avoid using "we" too frequently, for example "We also found that ...". Describe your methodology and your findings but don't describe your whole process.


I am showing all the codes and the result of them just so you can 
read it directly from the site. After other things are finished, I will make sure
those won't be visible. This part of text shall be deleted just like instructions
from the professor
Other plots and explanations shall be added here. Underneath are some new plots
to work with.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

data <- readRDS(here::here("dataset/cleaned_data_W_revenue_combined.rds"))
temp <- data |>
  mutate(average_income = PAYANN / EMP * 1000) |>
  filter(
    NAICS2017_LABEL == "Total for all sectors",
    ETH_GROUP_LABEL == "Total",
    SEX_LABEL %in% c("Male", "Female"),
    VET_GROUP_LABEL == "Total"
  )
ml <- lm(average_income ~ Population + SEX_LABEL, temp)
summary(ml)
# VETERAN Group is also checked in the model, 
# but didn't show enough significance to be considered
# On the other hand, it makes it fair to say 
# They are not getting the care they deserve.
# Since the other variables are non-relevant to the topic
# They are either partially ignored or just kept
# to add some diversity to the data.

# From the summary, both coefficient are positive and significant
# which means the people who belong to a more major race
# have a higher chance to get a better income
# as well as that for male.
# The plot below basically says the same thing.
```

categories <- categories[2:7]

ml_s <- lapply(categories, lm_s)
lapply(ml_s, summary)

# Here's an deeper look into each industry and their income for people 
# The six categories with most employees are chosen in this case.
# In most of them, Male employees are still getting more money excluding 
# <Administrative and support and waste management and remediation services> and
# <Accommodation and food services>, which is kind of fair when looking at. 
# However, only two industries can see some preference for offering
# higher wage for major race, which are <retail trade> and <manufacturing>

# I will stop analyzing here, since these are just some basic info.
# But when you guys are writing analysis, there should be a lot to be able to 
# talk about in this part I guess? This really seem like something you can really
# expand on easily.

# Underneath is also a plot of those categories to go with the topic, good luck!

# same thing with that graph, just with revenue.
# I guess it does say that minority races are also getting
# less revenue, which can be partially seen as less income and less revenue is 
# associated. 
# I don't think we need to go that deep like the previous income one,
# but it's just something fun to have

## Note on Attribution

In general, you should try to provide links to relevant resources, especially those that helped you. You don't have to link to every StackOverflow post you used but if there are explainers on aspects of the data or specific models that you found helpful, try to link to those. Also, try to link to other sources that might support (or refute) your analysis. These can just be regular hyperlinks. You don't need a formal citation.

If you are directly quoting from a source, please make that clear. You can show quotes using `>` like this

## Rubric: On this page

You will

-   Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
    -   Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
    -   What questions are you interested in answering?
    -   Provide context for the rest of the page. This will include figures/tables that illustrate aspects of the data of your question.
-   Modeling and Inference
    -   The page will include some kind of formal statistical model. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another modeling framework.
    -   Explain the ideas and techniques you used to choose the predictors for your model. (Think about including interaction terms and other transformations of your variables.)
    -   Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
-   Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
    -   Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions?
-   Clarity Figures
    -   Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
    -   Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)
    -   Default `lm` output and plots are typically not acceptable.
-   Clarity of Explanations
    -   How well do you explain each figure/result?
    -   Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
-   Organization and cleanliness.
    -   Make sure to remove excessive warnings, hide most or all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
    -   This page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data.
