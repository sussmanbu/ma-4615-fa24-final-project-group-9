The data was collected by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) in collaboration with the United States Census Bureau. The primary purpose of collecting this data was to provide comprehensive information about the characteristics of employees in metropolitan areas across various demographic dimensions, including sex, ethnicity, race, years in business, and veteran status. The intention behind this collection is to support research, inform policymakers, and offer valuable insights to the public.

## Data Background: 

This data comes from the United States Census Bureau and the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), covering from 2017 to 2021. The Nation Center for Science and Engineering Statistics collected the data provided. This data was collected to provide information on the sex, ethnicity, race, industry, and veteran status of employees in metro areas. More specifically, the data helps provide researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and the public with more information. We are partly 
able to find the data from the original source. NCSES works with the United States Census Bureau as part of the federal government and we are able to find the 
data from there. **

After an overall review, this data is collected comprehensively and doesn't contain big issue. We can see if the sample is biased through if it only includes 
certain groups. However, the population is representative of the broader community. For example, the data set includes loan applicants from broad regions, income 
brackets, racial groups, sex and veteran. It is relatively fair data.**

The data is often used to understand the characteristics of businesses in the U.S., such as their ownership (by sex, race, veteran status, etc.) and how long 
they’ve been in operation. Researchers might use this data to explore trends in business growth, diversity in ownership, or the challenges certain groups face in 
starting and sustaining businesses. Other research has used this data to study issues like disparities in business ownership across different demographic groups, 
and it can also be used for policy decisions. For example, government programs supporting minority-owned businesses or veteran entrepreneurs might rely on this 
data to tailor policies. **

Questions include: 
What factors contribute to business success? 
Are certain groups underrepresented in business ownership? 
What resources do different types of businesses need to grow?

## Date Cleaning: 

For our initial data cleaning, we started by selecting a subset of the data that contains key demographic and business characteristics, 
focusing on columns with minimal missing values to ensure a more reliable analysis. We first removed rows with significant missing data
to avoid skewing our results but kept those with minor gaps for further inspection. As part of exploratory data analysis (EDA), we 
checked for unusual patterns, such as outliers, unexpectedly frequent or infrequent values, and relationships that align with or deviate
from known trends. Below is an initial visualization showing the distribution of businesses by owner race and industry, helping us spot 
potential data inconsistencies or biases.

## Data Equity:

The first principle, justice, means treating everyone in our data fairly. If we're analyzing factors like race, gender, or income, we need to make sure our data 
collection and analysis don’t favor one group over another. This ensures that all groups are represented equally, and the findings don’t carry any unfair bias. The 
second principle, respect for persons, focuses on people’s right to make their own choices. This means giving people the information they need to understand the 
data and allowing them the freedom to act on it. If someone has limits, like age, a disability, or difficulty with language, they deserve extra support to 
understand and participate fully in the process.

Transparency is key, but our analysis might have limitations. While the data from the U.S. Census Bureau and NCSES is comprehensive and diverse, it only covers 2017-
2021, potentially missing recent trends. Though the dataset aims to be representative, some subgroups may still be underrepresented. Acknowledging these limitations 
ensures responsible use and accurate insights into business growth, diversity, and resource needs.
