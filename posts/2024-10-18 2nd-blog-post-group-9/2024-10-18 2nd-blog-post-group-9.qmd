This week, our group worked on checking the data background, finding the issue of the data and generally cleaning it. Next week, we will discuss how to clean the 
data specifically and the data equity. 

Data Background: 

**This data comes from the United States Census Bureau and the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The Nation Center for Science and 
Engineering Statistics collected the data provided. This data was collected to provide information on the sex, ethnicity, race, industry, and veteran status of 
employees in metro areas. More specifically, the data helps provide researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and the public with more information. We are partly 
able to find the data from the original source. NCSES works with the United States Census Bureau as part of the federal government and we are able to find the 
data from there. **

**After an overall review, this data is collected comprehensively and doesn't contain big issue. We can see if the sample is biased through if it only includes 
certain groups. However, the population is representative of the broader community. For example, the data set includes loan applicants from broad regions, income 
brackets, racial groups, sex and veteran. It is relatively fair data.**

**The data is often used to understand the characteristics of businesses in the U.S., such as their ownership (by sex, race, veteran status, etc.) and how long 
theyâ€™ve been in operation. Researchers might use this data to explore trends in business growth, diversity in ownership, or the challenges certain groups face in 
starting and sustaining businesses. Other research has used this data to study issues like disparities in business ownership across different demographic groups, 
and it can also be used for policy decisions. For example, government programs supporting minority-owned businesses or veteran entrepreneurs might rely on this 
data to tailor policies. **

Questions include: 
What factors contribute to business success? 
Are certain groups underrepresented in business ownership? 
What resources do different types of businesses need to grow?
