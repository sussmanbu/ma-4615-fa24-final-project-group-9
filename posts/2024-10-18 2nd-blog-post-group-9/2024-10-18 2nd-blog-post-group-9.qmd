## Where does the data come from? Who collected it? Why was it collected? Are you able to find the data from the original source?
This data comes from the United States Census Bureau and the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The Nation Center for Science and Engineering Statistics collected the data provided. This data was collected to provide information on the sex, ethnicity, race, industry, and veteran status of employees in metro areas. More specifically, the data helps provide researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and the public with more information. We are partly able to find the data from the original source. NCSES works with the United States Census Bureau as part of the federal government and we are able to find the data from there. 


## Are there any issues you can see with how the data was collected? What is the sample population? Are there reasons to think the sample is biased in some way?


## How is this data used? Has there been other research on the same data? Is this data being used for some policy decisions? What questions have others ask about this data?
