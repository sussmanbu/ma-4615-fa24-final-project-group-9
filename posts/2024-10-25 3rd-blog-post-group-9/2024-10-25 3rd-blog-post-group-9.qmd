Data Equity:

The first principle, justice, means treating everyone in our data fairly. If we're analyzing factors like race, gender, or income, we need to make sure our data 
collection and analysis don’t favor one group over another. This ensures that all groups are represented equally, and the findings don’t carry any unfair bias. The 
second principle, respect for persons, focuses on people’s right to make their own choices. This means giving people the information they need to understand the 
data and allowing them the freedom to act on it. If someone has limits, like age, a disability, or difficulty with language, they deserve extra support to 
understand and participate fully in the process.

Transparency is key, but our analysis might have limitations. While the data from the U.S. Census Bureau and NCSES is comprehensive and diverse, it only covers 2017-
2021, potentially missing recent trends. Though the dataset aims to be representative, some subgroups may still be underrepresented. Acknowledging these limitations 
ensures responsible use and accurate insights into business growth, diversity, and resource needs.
