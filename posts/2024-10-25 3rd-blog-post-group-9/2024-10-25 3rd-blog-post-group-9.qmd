Date Cleaning: 

For our initial data cleaning, we started by selecting a subset of the data that contains key demographic and business characteristics, 
focusing on columns with minimal missing values to ensure a more reliable analysis. We first removed rows with significant missing data
to avoid skewing our results but kept those with minor gaps for further inspection. As part of exploratory data analysis (EDA), we 
checked for unusual patterns, such as outliers, unexpectedly frequent or infrequent values, and relationships that align with or deviate
from known trends. Below is an initial visualization showing the distribution of businesses by owner race and industry, helping us spot 
potential data inconsistencies or biases.




Data Equity:

The first principle, justice, means treating everyone in our data fairly. If we're analyzing factors like race, gender, or income, we need to make sure our data 
collection and analysis don’t favor one group over another. This ensures that all groups are represented equally, and the findings don’t carry any unfair bias. The 
second principle, respect for persons, focuses on people’s right to make their own choices. This means giving people the information they need to understand the 
data and allowing them the freedom to act on it. If someone has limits, like age, a disability, or difficulty with language, they deserve extra support to 
understand and participate fully in the process.

Transparency is key, but our analysis might have limitations. While the data from the U.S. Census Bureau and NCSES is comprehensive and diverse, it only covers 2017-
2021, potentially missing recent trends. Though the dataset aims to be representative, some subgroups may still be underrepresented. Acknowledging these limitations 
ensures responsible use and accurate insights into business growth, diversity, and resource needs.
