    "text": "NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-arrest-data-year-to-date This data set includes 19 columns and 128778 rows. This data was gathered to record an arrest conducted by the NYPD and includes information such as the location, time, and type of crime. The data set also includes information about the suspect demographics. This data is manually picked by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning in the NYPD and is extracted from a larger pool of arrests recorded. The NYPD extracts this data quarterly. We can load and clean the data set. The questions we hope to address when using this data set are: 1. What time of year are most crimes reported? 2. What race, age group, and sex most frequently shows up as the perpetrator 3. Which precinct collects the most arrests? 4. Are there certain crimes that each gender does more frequently? Some of the potential challenges for this data set are that the variable names aren’t always very clear and there are many values in the data set which can make managing some of the results we find difficult and complex.\nNational Statistics by Parent Income Percentile, Gender, and Race (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ces/data/public-use-data/race-and-economic-opportunity-data-tables.html) Description: Num_of_columns: 69 Num_of_rows: 101 Why: The data was collected to study intergenerational mobility by examining how parent income impacts various child outcomes across different races and genders. How: The data was gathered from large-scale administrative and census data sources. It is based on children born between 1978-1983 and tracks their outcomes, such as education, employment, and income. Loading and Cleaning: Yes, the dataset has very little missing values.\nMain Questions: Intergenerational Mobility: How does a parent’s income percentile affect their child’s income rank, educational attainment, and other life outcomes? Racial and Gender Disparities: How do outcomes such as education, employment, incarceration, and income vary by race and gender across different parent income percentiles? Impact of Family Structure: How does family structure (e.g., single-parent vs. two-parent households) impact child outcomes across different races and income levels? College Attendance and Employment: What is the relationship between parent income and a child’s likelihood of attending college or securing employment by race and gender? Complexity of Analysis: The intersection of parent income percentile, race, gender, and various child outcomes creates a highly multidimensional dataset, which could make it challenging to interpret findings without clear methods for managing these complexities.\nJobs NYC Postings https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-jobs This dataset includes 5347 rows and 30 columns, it contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). It includes the posting type(internal/external), job category, salary range (from/to), posting date, residency requirement…We are able to load and clean the dataset, and I hope to address what is the requirement or description of the job which has the highest salary range. There are some potential challenges because some data are kind of messy and described in different words, like the job description/the minimum qual requirements/preferred skill, they might lead to more complex results.\nPopular baby names https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/popular-baby-names There are 6 columns and 69214 rows in this data. The six columns describes the actual name, the year it was collected, the ethnicity this name belongs to, the gender that the name is used, the count of the use of that name in that year with a minimum of 10, and how it is ranked that year in that specific gender and ethnicity.By description, this data is collected by Sex and Ethnicity Group Data through civil birth registration. I had no problem loading and performing some cleaning to the data. I believe that followings could be studied from that data: The preference difference in people choosing the name for the child based on their culture. By putting the names into a histogram group by ethnicity, we might see how each ethnicity has a sharper distribution and review some differences based on that. How the popularity of each individual name has changed. Instead of looking at the data based on ethnicity, looking at the data’s trends based on the years would also provide useful information on how people are changing their preferences."

    "text": "Date Cleaning:\nFor our initial data cleaning, we started by selecting a subset of the data that contains key demographic and business characteristics, focusing on columns with minimal missing values to ensure a more reliable analysis. We first removed rows with significant missing data to avoid skewing our results but kept those with minor gaps for further inspection. As part of exploratory data analysis (EDA), we checked for unusual patterns, such as outliers, unexpectedly frequent or infrequent values, and relationships that align with or deviate from known trends. Below is an initial visualization showing the distribution of businesses by owner race and industry, helping us spot potential data inconsistencies or biases.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\ndata &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"dataset/cleaned_data_N_revenue.rds\"))\ndata |&gt;\n  filter(RACE_GROUP_LABEL != \"Total\",\n         NAICS2017_LABEL == \"Total for all sectors\",\n         SEX_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         ETH_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         VET_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         YEAR == 2017) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = RACE_GROUP_LABEL, y = FIRMPDEMP, fill = RACE_GROUP_LABEL), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  xlab(\"Major race for company\") +\n  ylab(\"Total amount of firms\")\n\n\n\ndata |&gt;\n  filter(RACE_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         NAICS2017_LABEL != \"Total for all sectors\",\n         SEX_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         ETH_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         VET_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         YEAR == 2017) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = NAICS2017_LABEL, y = FIRMPDEMP, fill = NAICS2017_LABEL), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  xlab(\"Major industry for company\") +\n  ylab(\"Total amount of firms\")\n\n\n\n\nData Equity:\nThe first principle, justice, means treating everyone in our data fairly. If we’re analyzing factors like race, gender, or income, we need to make sure our data collection and analysis don’t favor one group over another. This ensures that all groups are represented equally, and the findings don’t carry any unfair bias. The second principle, respect for persons, focuses on people’s right to make their own choices. This means giving people the information they need to understand the data and allowing them the freedom to act on it. If someone has limits, like age, a disability, or difficulty with language, they deserve extra support to understand and participate fully in the process.\nTransparency is key, but our analysis might have limitations. While the data from the U.S. Census Bureau and NCSES is comprehensive and diverse, it only covers 2017- 2021, potentially missing recent trends. Though the dataset aims to be representative, some subgroups may still be underrepresented. Acknowledging these limitations ensures responsible use and accurate insights into business growth, diversity, and resource needs."

A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.\nInitially, you will study one dataset but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components."

An overly long analysis could lead to losing points. If you want you can link back to your blog posts or create separate pages with more details.\nThe style of this paper should aim to be that of an academic paper. I don’t expect this to be of publication quality but you should keep that aim in mind. Avoid using “we” too frequently, for example “We also found that …”. Describe your methodology and your findings but don’t describe your whole process."

    "text": "NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-arrest-data-year-to-date This data set includes 19 columns and 128778 rows. This data was gathered to record an arrest conducted by the NYPD and includes information such as the location, time, and type of crime. The data set also includes information about the suspect demographics. This data is manually picked by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning in the NYPD and is extracted from a larger pool of arrests recorded. The NYPD extracts this data quarterly. We can load and clean the data set. The questions we hope to address when using this data set are: 1. What time of year are most crimes reported? 2. What race, age group, and sex most frequently shows up as the perpetrator 3. Which precinct collects the most arrests? 4. Are there certain crimes that each gender does more frequently? Some of the potential challenges for this data set are that the variable names aren’t always very clear and there are many values in the data set which can make managing some of the results we find difficult and complex.\nNational Statistics by Parent Income Percentile, Gender, and Race (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ces/data/public-use-data/race-and-economic-opportunity-data-tables.html) Description: Num_of_columns: 69 Num_of_rows: 101 Why: The data was collected to study intergenerational mobility by examining how parent income impacts various child outcomes across different races and genders. How: The data was gathered from large-scale administrative and census data sources. It is based on children born between 1978-1983 and tracks their outcomes, such as education, employment, and income. Loading and Cleaning: Yes, the dataset has very little missing values.\nMain Questions: Intergenerational Mobility: How does a parent’s income percentile affect their child’s income rank, educational attainment, and other life outcomes? Racial and Gender Disparities: How do outcomes such as education, employment, incarceration, and income vary by race and gender across different parent income percentiles? Impact of Family Structure: How does family structure (e.g., single-parent vs. two-parent households) impact child outcomes across different races and income levels? College Attendance and Employment: What is the relationship between parent income and a child’s likelihood of attending college or securing employment by race and gender? Complexity of Analysis: The intersection of parent income percentile, race, gender, and various child outcomes creates a highly multidimensional dataset, which could make it challenging to interpret findings without clear methods for managing these complexities.\nJobs NYC Postings https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-jobs This dataset includes 5347 rows and 30 columns, it contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). It includes the posting type(internal/external), job category, salary range (from/to), posting date, residency requirement…We are able to load and clean the dataset, and I hope to address what is the requirement or description of the job which has the highest salary range. There are some potential challenges because some data are kind of messy and described in different words, like the job description/the minimum qual requirements/preferred skill, they might lead to more complex results.\nPopular baby names (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/popular-baby-names) have 6 columns and 69214 rows in this data. The six columns describes the actual name, the year it was collected, the ethnicity this name belongs to, the gender that the name is used, the count of the use of that name in that year with a minimum of 10, and how it is ranked that year in that specific gender and ethnicity.By description, this data is collected by Sex and Ethnicity Group Data through civil birth registration. I had no problem loading and performing some cleaning to the data. I believe that followings could be studied from that data: The preference difference in people choosing the name for the child based on their culture. By putting the names into a histogram group by ethnicity, we might see how each ethnicity has a sharper distribution and review some differences based on that. How the popularity of each individual name has changed. Instead of looking at the data based on ethnicity, looking at the data’s trends based on the years would also provide useful information on how people are changing their preferences."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "This week, our group worked on checking the data background, finding the issue of the data and generally cleaning it. Next week, we will discuss how to clean the data specifically and the data equity.\nData Background:\nThis data comes from the United States Census Bureau and the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The Nation Center for Science and Engineering Statistics collected the data provided. This data was collected to provide information on the sex, ethnicity, race, industry, and veteran status of employees in metro areas. More specifically, the data helps provide researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and the public with more information. We are partly able to find the data from the original source. NCSES works with the United States Census Bureau as part of the federal government and we are able to find the data from there. \nAfter an overall review, this data is collected comprehensively and doesn’t contain big issue. We can see if the sample is biased through if it only includes certain groups. However, the population is representative of the broader community. For example, the data set includes loan applicants from broad regions, income brackets, racial groups, sex and veteran. It is relatively fair data.\nThe data is often used to understand the characteristics of businesses in the U.S., such as their ownership (by sex, race, veteran status, etc.) and how long they’ve been in operation. Researchers might use this data to explore trends in business growth, diversity in ownership, or the challenges certain groups face in starting and sustaining businesses. Other research has used this data to study issues like disparities in business ownership across different demographic groups, and it can also be used for policy decisions. For example, government programs supporting minority-owned businesses or veteran entrepreneurs might rely on this data to tailor policies. \nQuestions include: What factors contribute to business success? Are certain groups underrepresented in business ownership? What resources do different types of businesses need to grow?"

However, as a very significant numerical variable, it would be a pretty big loss to the data set if we really completely ignore this variable and let it go. As a result, two sets of cleaned data was presented, one with the revenues presented but as a result of data cleaning, there are only 16879 data points left, and one without without the revenue variable to provide more information about all other variables, and as a result, has 43575 data points left.\nAfter all works done, the data has seven categorical variables, which includes the sector of industry of the company, the sex label, the ethical group label, the race label, the veteran label, the time company has been in the industry and the year that data was collected. There are also three numerical variables including the number of employers, the number of employees and their payrolls. The standard error for those variables are also included.

All other races either remain very low in average employee count or grow slightly. These other numbers also stagnated at their lower average numbers."
