    "text": "NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-arrest-data-year-to-date This data set includes 19 columns and 128778 rows. This data was gathered to record an arrest conducted by the NYPD and includes information such as the location, time, and type of crime. The data set also includes information about the suspect demographics. This data is manually picked by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning in the NYPD and is extracted from a larger pool of arrests recorded. The NYPD extracts this data quarterly. We can load and clean the data set. The questions we hope to address when using this data set are: 1. What time of year are most crimes reported? 2. What race, age group, and sex most frequently shows up as the perpetrator 3. Which precinct collects the most arrests? 4. Are there certain crimes that each gender does more frequently? Some of the potential challenges for this data set are that the variable names aren’t always very clear and there are many values in the data set which can make managing some of the results we find difficult and complex.\nNational Statistics by Parent Income Percentile, Gender, and Race (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ces/data/public-use-data/race-and-economic-opportunity-data-tables.html) Description: Num_of_columns: 69 Num_of_rows: 101 Why: The data was collected to study intergenerational mobility by examining how parent income impacts various child outcomes across different races and genders. How: The data was gathered from large-scale administrative and census data sources. It is based on children born between 1978-1983 and tracks their outcomes, such as education, employment, and income. Loading and Cleaning: Yes, the dataset has very little missing values.\nMain Questions: Intergenerational Mobility: How does a parent’s income percentile affect their child’s income rank, educational attainment, and other life outcomes? Racial and Gender Disparities: How do outcomes such as education, employment, incarceration, and income vary by race and gender across different parent income percentiles? Impact of Family Structure: How does family structure (e.g., single-parent vs. two-parent households) impact child outcomes across different races and income levels? College Attendance and Employment: What is the relationship between parent income and a child’s likelihood of attending college or securing employment by race and gender? Complexity of Analysis: The intersection of parent income percentile, race, gender, and various child outcomes creates a highly multidimensional dataset, which could make it challenging to interpret findings without clear methods for managing these complexities.\nJobs NYC Postings https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-jobs This dataset includes 5347 rows and 30 columns, it contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). It includes the posting type(internal/external), job category, salary range (from/to), posting date, residency requirement…We are able to load and clean the dataset, and I hope to address what is the requirement or description of the job which has the highest salary range. There are some potential challenges because some data are kind of messy and described in different words, like the job description/the minimum qual requirements/preferred skill, they might lead to more complex results.\nPopular baby names https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/popular-baby-names There are 6 columns and 69214 rows in this data. The six columns describes the actual name, the year it was collected, the ethnicity this name belongs to, the gender that the name is used, the count of the use of that name in that year with a minimum of 10, and how it is ranked that year in that specific gender and ethnicity.By description, this data is collected by Sex and Ethnicity Group Data through civil birth registration. I had no problem loading and performing some cleaning to the data. I believe that followings could be studied from that data: The preference difference in people choosing the name for the child based on their culture. By putting the names into a histogram group by ethnicity, we might see how each ethnicity has a sharper distribution and review some differences based on that. How the popularity of each individual name has changed. Instead of looking at the data based on ethnicity, looking at the data’s trends based on the years would also provide useful information on how people are changing their preferences. —"

    "text": "While cleaning the data, there was one specific variable, the revenue, which has way more NA values in it than any other variables. However, as a very significant numerical variable, it would be a pretty big loss to the data set if we really completely ignore this variable and let it go. As a result, two sets of cleaned data was presented, one with the revenues presented but as a result of data cleaning, there are only 16879 data points left, and one without without the revenue variable to provide more information about all other variables, and as a result, has 43575 data points left.\nAfter all works done, the data has seven categorical variables, which includes the sector of industry of the company, the sex label, the ethical group label, the race label, the veteran label, the time company has been in the industry and the year that data was collected. There are also three numerical variables including the number of employers, the number of employees and their payrolls. The standard error for those variables are also included. In one of the data sets, the revenue and standard error for the revenue is also included.\n\ndata &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"dataset/cleaned_data_N_revenue.rds\"))\n\ndata\n# Basic data exploration\nstr(data)\nsummary(data)\n\n## Average Employment Trends by Race\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Function to format numbers in millions\nformat_m &lt;- function(x) {\n  paste0(round(x/1000000, 1), \"M\")\n}\n\n\n# Employment trends by race\ndata %&gt;%\n  filter(!RACE_GROUP_LABEL %in% c(\"Total\", \"Unclassifiable\", \"Classifiable\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(YEAR, RACE_GROUP_LABEL) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_employment = mean(EMP), .groups = 'drop') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = YEAR, y = avg_employment, color = RACE_GROUP_LABEL)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Average Employment Trends by Race\",\n       subtitle = \"Excluding Total, Unclassifiable, and Classifiable categories\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Number of Employees (M)\",\n       color = \"Race\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = format_m) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nIn this table we are able to see the average employment trends by race. The trend starts in 2017 and ends in 2021. While most race categories during this time remain below the 1 million average number mark, the White and Non-minority race categories quickly rise in the first year and remain fairly stagnant at about the 4 million average employee mark. All other races either remain very low in average employee count or grow slightly. These other numbers also stagnated at their lower average numbers.\n\n# Load your data\ndata &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"dataset/cleaned_data_N_revenue.rds\")) \ndata_long &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(SEX_LABEL) |&gt;\n  select(SEX_LABEL, YEAR, PAYANN)\n\n# Select relevant columns for plotting\nggplot(data_long, aes(x = YEAR, y = PAYANN))+\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Annual Pay Trends by Sex\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Annual Pay (PAYANN)\",\n    color = \"Sex\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart shows the trend in annual pay from 2017 to 2021, with a notable peak in 2017, followed by a sharp decrease in 2018, and relative stability from 2018 to 2021. The initial high level in 2017 suggests that this year had an unusual spike in earnings, significantly above the levels seen in subsequent years.\nFrom 2017 to 2018, there was a significant drop in annual pay. This decline might be due to one-time factors that impacted 2017, such as special bonuses, incentives, or policy changes that increased earnings temporarily. Additionally, shifts in economic conditions or organizational budget adjustments could explain the substantial decrease seen in 2018.\nBetween 2018 and 2021, the annual pay stabilized, with only minor fluctuations. This steady trend may reflect a period of economic balance or consistent salary structures, suggesting that the organization or industry aimed for controlled spending and sustainable pay levels. Economic factors, such as inflation adjustments or policy regulations, might have contributed to maintaining this stable pay pattern.\nOverall, the data indicates that after the spike in 2017, annual pay was adjusted to a more sustainable level in subsequent years. This pattern suggests possible restructuring or cost-cutting measures aimed at achieving long-term financial stability."

There were no major issues getting the census data; however, it did take a bit of time to combine all the years we wanted to examine into one final dataset. When the data was finally combined, we created a facet-wrapped graph that was grouped by race and filtered by sex. The facet-wrap was done by race as well. Using this graph, we can see the population by race and sex per year. There is a clear majority for the “White” population when combining the data and other racial groups such as, “Asian”, “Black”, and “Some Other Race” trail behind. The split between genders (Male and Female) is somewhat even in all racial groups."

    "text": "This week, our group worked on checking the data background, finding the issue of the data and generally cleaning it. Next week, we will discuss how to clean the data specifically and the data equity.\nData Background:\nThis data comes from the United States Census Bureau and the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). The Nation Center for Science and Engineering Statistics collected the data provided. This data was collected to provide information on the sex, ethnicity, race, industry, and veteran status of employees in metro areas. More specifically, the data helps provide researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and the public with more information. We are partly able to find the data from the original source. NCSES works with the United States Census Bureau as part of the federal government and we are able to find the data from there. \nAfter an overall review, this data is collected comprehensively and doesn’t contain big issue. We can see if the sample is biased through if it only includes certain groups. However, the population is representative of the broader community. For example, the data set includes loan applicants from broad regions, income brackets, racial groups, sex and veteran. It is relatively fair data.\nThe data is often used to understand the characteristics of businesses in the U.S., such as their ownership (by sex, race, veteran status, etc.) and how long they’ve been in operation. Researchers might use this data to explore trends in business growth, diversity in ownership, or the challenges certain groups face in starting and sustaining businesses. Other research has used this data to study issues like disparities in business ownership across different demographic groups, and it can also be used for policy decisions. For example, government programs supporting minority-owned businesses or veteran entrepreneurs might rely on this data to tailor policies. \nQuestions include: What factors contribute to business success? Are certain groups underrepresented in business ownership? What resources do different types of businesses need to grow?"

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

Some of the potential challenges for this data set are that the variable names aren’t always very clear and there are many values in the data set which can make managing some of the results we find difficult and complex.\nNational Statistics by Parent Income Percentile, Gender, and Race (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ces/data/public-use-data/race-and-economic-opportunity-data-tables.html) Description: Num_of_columns: 69 Num_of_rows: 101 Why: The data was collected to study intergenerational mobility by examining how parent income impacts various child outcomes across different races and genders. How: The data was gathered from large-scale administrative and census data sources. It is based on children born between 1978-1983 and tracks their outcomes, such as education, employment, and income. Loading and Cleaning: Yes, the dataset has very little missing values.\nMain Questions: Intergenerational Mobility: How does a parent’s income percentile affect their child’s income rank, educational attainment, and other life outcomes? Racial and Gender Disparities: How do outcomes such as education, employment, incarceration, and income vary by race and gender across different parent income percentiles? Impact of Family Structure: How does family structure (e.g., single-parent vs. two-parent households) impact child outcomes across different races and income levels? College Attendance and Employment: What is the relationship between parent income and a child’s likelihood of attending college or securing employment by race and gender? Complexity of Analysis: The intersection of parent income percentile, race, gender, and various child outcomes creates a highly multidimensional dataset, which could make it challenging to interpret findings without clear methods for managing these complexities.\nJobs NYC Postings https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-jobs This dataset includes 5347 rows and 30 columns, it contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). It includes the posting type(internal/external), job category, salary range (from/to), posting date, residency requirement…We are able to load and clean the dataset, and I hope to address what is the requirement or description of the job which has the highest salary range. There are some potential challenges because some data are kind of messy and described in different words, like the job description/the minimum qual requirements/preferred skill, they might lead to more complex results.\nPopular baby names (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/popular-baby-names) have 6 columns and 69214 rows in this data. The six columns describes the actual name, the year it was collected, the ethnicity this name belongs to, the gender that the name is used, the count of the use of that name in that year with a minimum of 10, and how it is ranked that year in that specific gender and ethnicity.By description, this data is collected by Sex and Ethnicity Group Data through civil birth registration. I had no problem loading and performing some cleaning to the data. I believe that followings could be studied from that data: The preference difference in people choosing the name for the child based on their culture. By putting the names into a histogram group by ethnicity, we might see how each ethnicity has a sharper distribution and review some differences based on that. How the popularity of each individual name has changed. Instead of looking at the data based on ethnicity, looking at the data’s trends based on the years would also provide useful information on how people are changing their preferences."

    "text": "Uncovering Bias: Diving into the makeup of American businesses\nThe United States is well known for having a diverse, efficient, and opportunistic economic industry. Due to this, the US economy has thrived for the past few decades resulting in political and cultural power over other countries and stability for it’s citizens. Despite this economic growth however, many still question if there is equal opportunity for all kinds of employees based on race, gender, and industry type. Our investigation of the relationship between US census demographics and industry types/economic trends calls attention to if there is inequality for minority groups in the US job industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Basics: Male vs Female\nTo begin, let’s look at the difference in Male and Female average income in 2021. The figure above illustrates both male and female average income in USD. The results show a sizable difference between the two variables with men earning several thousands more than women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Differences in Race\nThe next graph illustrates the differences in income based on race. Using various different races such as White, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, Asian, American Indian and Alaska Native, and Black or African American, we are able to see clear discrepancies in the average income based on race in 2021. We are able to see that the White group is earning more than 50,000 dollars and more than 10,000 dollars more than the Black or African American group which is the lowest. These results raise questions on whether the US job industry provides equal earning opportunity to all Americans regardless of their race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Jobs Are Biggest?\nTo help provide more information to further investigate the US job industry, we will next look at the population differences for each industry. The pie chart above shows that the “Other” industry has the highest employment while industries such as “Retail trade” and “Health care and social assistance” are the next biggest. This information tells what kinds of jobs US employees are working and can help explain income information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquality From Top To Bottom?\nRecently there has been major discussions on income for employees relative to how much corporations are making. The graph above shows that corporations do provide slight increases towards employees’ salaries, however, the same corporations are making large increases in their profits. Most income for employees somewhat plateaus in the 80,000 dollar range and salaries only slightly increase to just under 90,000 dollars.\n\n\nConclusion\nUsing the information we have gathered from both data sources and creating the various graphs, we have uncovered that there are still problems in the US economy regarding issues on income equality. We were able to highlight issues on race, gender, and general industry information and found that certain groups such as women and African Americans still lag behind in our job industry.\nReflecting on these results, it becomes more aware that more needs to be done to provide equal opportunities to American families concerning their income earning opportunities. US corporations are still increasing their revenues, however, there are still discrepancies in the “sharing” of this wealth."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe U.S. job market has changed a lot in recent years because of new technology, the effects of globalization, and the needs of different industries. These changes have made it harder for people to compete for jobs, and many workers, researchers, and policymakers are trying to figure out what’s behind these shifts and how they impact job opportunities and participation in the workforce. This study focuses on understanding the patterns of employment in the U.S., especially looking at how race, income, and job types interact to affect who gets jobs and how much they earn. To do this, analysis can be conducted with the data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) to study job trends from 2017 to 2021. The main questions include: Do job opportunities differ for people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds? How does the kind of job someone has relate to their income level? Are there big differences in who participates in the workforce across various groups, and what might be the reasons for these gaps? The analysis will conduct a model and use charts and tables to make these ideas clearer, showing trends and differences in jobs and income. By breaking this down, the goal is to understand the social and economic factors that shape today’s U.S. job market in a way that’s easy to grasp.\nDate Cleaning\nFor our initial data cleaning, we started by selecting a subset of the data that contains key demographic and business characteristics, focusing on columns with minimal missing values to ensure a more reliable analysis. We first removed rows with significant missing data to avoid skewing our results but kept those with minor gaps for further inspection. As part of exploratory data analysis (EDA), we checked for unusual patterns, such as outliers, unexpectedly frequent or infrequent values, and relationships that align with or deviate from known trends. Below is an initial visualization showing the distribution of businesses by owner race and industry, helping us spot potential data inconsistencies or biases."

    "text": "Analysis\n\nRace and employment\n\nOne of the issues in the analysis of employment data is the disparity between different racial groups, reflecting structural inequality in the labor market.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line graph shows the average number of employees across racial categories from 2017 to 2021, excluding “Total”, “Unclassifiable”, and “Classifiable” categories. The line for the “White” population (nonminority) consistently shows the highest average employment numbers. While other racial groups like “Asian”, “Black or African American” have comparatively lower and more consistent employment averages over the years.\nIn 2018, almost all races had the largest increase in average employment, especially for the “White” category. Based on the background information, we can infer that the reason might be attributed to the strong economic growth in the U.S., which increased job availability. This likely benefited the largest demographic group (“White”) more due to the pre-existing economic advantages.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the impact of race and years in business on average income levels from 2017 to 2021. Same as the previous analysis, “Nonminority” firms consistently earn higher incomes compared to “Minority” and “Equally minority/nonminority” firms, with long-established businesses (16+ years) outperforming newer firms across all categories. The year 2019 saw a sharp income spike, particularly for younger firms, which suggest that the potential reason that policies such as Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, streamlined regulatory processes, increased federal procurement opportunities, and entrepreneurship promotion programs created a supportive environment for younger firms to thrive and achieve higher average incomes.\nHowever, in the graph, from 2019 to 2020, there is a big decrease, potential because the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused a notable decline across all groups, disproportionately affecting minority-owned and younger businesses. By 2021, income levels began recovering, with established “Non Minority” firms recovering more quickly than others, underscoring systemic disparities in resilience and resource access.\n\nDifferent kinds of employment\n\nThe type of jobs is also a key factor in affecting employment in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph shows the distribution of job opportunities across various industries based on the number of firms. It demonstrates that industries like professional, scientific, and technical services dominate the job market in terms of the number of firms, indicating their pivotal role in the economy. This suggests that sectors driven by knowledge, innovation, and essential services are central to the U.S. employment landscape, reflecting broader economic trends that prioritize these areas for growth and development.\n\nPopulation and income(linear regression)\n\nRevenue could influence income by enabling higher wages and job growth. It can be analyzed at which stage revenue has the greatest impact and the reasons behind this.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image shows the relationship between revenue and income. The red line shows a positive relationship between revenue and income overall. This suggests that as revenue increases, income tends to rise as well. The blue curve shows a nonlinear relationship between revenue and income, which can infer that first, at low revenue, income increases quickly. Secondly, at higher revenue, income growth slows and eventually flattens or slightly decreases.\nIn conclusion, at the lower end of revenue, employment may increase income because businesses are growing, creating jobs, and offering higher wages. Besides, as revenue grows larger, income growth slows, potential because companies focus on efficiency rather than hiring and fewer additional employees are needed as revenue grows.\n\nSex and employment\n\nIn society, there are certain gender barriers, and different types of employment may exhibit preferences or inequalities toward specific genders.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this bar chart, male employment significantly exceeds female employment, especially for the industries like: construction, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing. These industries traditionally employ a higher percentage of males due to the nature of the work like manual labor. The dominance in the female employment industry are health care and social assistance, administrative and support services, which are often aligned with traditional roles associated with women.\nInequality in employment resources between men and women may also imply inequality in average wages.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart illustrates the average wage by gender across various industries, which shows that male employees earn higher average wages overall, especially for some high-paying industries such as utilities, information, finance and insurance, showcasing gender inequality in wage distribution within these fields. In some low-wage industries like accommodation and food services, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, females earn more. These patterns emphasize systemic wage disparities tied to both gender and industry type, suggesting unequal access to high-paying roles and industries for female employees."

This data was collected to provide information on the sex, ethnicity, race, industry, and veteran status of employees in metro areas. More specifically, the data helps provide researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and the public with more information. We are partly able to find the data from the original source. NCSES works with the United States Census Bureau as part of the federal government and we are able to find the data from there. **\nAfter an overall review, this data is collected comprehensively and doesn’t contain big issue. We can see if the sample is biased through if it only includes certain groups. However, the population is representative of the broader community. For example, the data set includes loan applicants from broad regions, income brackets, racial groups, sex and veteran. It is relatively fair data.**\nThe data is often used to understand the characteristics of businesses in the U.S., such as their ownership (by sex, race, veteran status, etc.) and how long they’ve been in operation. Researchers might use this data to explore trends in business growth, diversity in ownership, or the challenges certain groups face in starting and sustaining businesses. Other research has used this data to study issues like disparities in business ownership across different demographic groups, and it can also be used for policy decisions. For example, government programs supporting minority-owned businesses or veteran entrepreneurs might rely on this data to tailor policies. **\nQuestions include: What factors contribute to business success? Are certain groups underrepresented in business ownership? What resources do different types of businesses need to grow?"

If we’re analyzing factors like race, gender, or income, we need to make sure our data collection and analysis don’t favor one group over another. This ensures that all groups are represented equally, and the findings don’t carry any unfair bias. The second principle, respect for persons, focuses on people’s right to make their own choices. This means giving people the information they need to understand the data and allowing them the freedom to act on it. If someone has limits, like age, a disability, or difficulty with language, they deserve extra support to understand and participate fully in the process.\nTransparency is key, but our analysis might have limitations. While the data from the U.S. Census Bureau and NCSES is comprehensive and diverse, it only covers 2017- 2021, potentially missing recent trends. Though the dataset aims to be representative, some subgroups may still be underrepresented. Acknowledging these limitations ensures responsible use and accurate insights into business growth, diversity, and resource needs."

When the data was finally combined, we created a facet-wrapped graph that was grouped by race and filtered by sex. The facet-wrap was done by race as well. Using this graph, we can see the population by race and sex per year. There is a clear majority for the “White” population when combining the data and other racial groups such as, “Asian”, “Black”, and “Some Other Race” trail behind.

This data is manually picked by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning in the NYPD and is extracted from a larger pool of arrests recorded. The NYPD extracts this data quarterly. We can load and clean the data set. The questions we hope to address when using this data set are: What time of year are most crimes reported? What race, age group, and sex most frequently shows up as the perpetrator Which precinct collects the most arrests? Are there certain crimes that each gender does more frequently? Some of the potential challenges for this data set are that the variable names aren’t always very clear and there are many values in the data set which can make managing some of the results we find difficult and complex.\n##National Statistics by Parent Income Percentile, Gender, and Race Link: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ces/data/public-use-data/race-and-economic-opportunity-data-tables.html Num_of_columns: 69 Num_of_rows: 101 Why: The data was collected to study intergenerational mobility by examining how parent income impacts various child outcomes across different races and genders. How: The data was gathered from large-scale administrative and census data sources. It is based on children born between 1978-1983 and tracks their outcomes, such as education, employment, and income. Loading and Cleaning: Yes, the dataset has very little missing values.\nMain Questions: Intergenerational Mobility: How does a parent’s income percentile affect their child’s income rank, educational attainment, and other life outcomes? Racial and Gender Disparities: How do outcomes such as education, employment, incarceration, and income vary by race and gender across different parent income percentiles? Impact of Family Structure: How does family structure (e.g., single-parent vs. two-parent households) impact child outcomes across different races and income levels? College Attendance and Employment: What is the relationship between parent income and a child’s likelihood of attending college or securing employment by race and gender? Challenge: Complexity of Analysis: The intersection of parent income percentile, race, gender, and various child outcomes creates a highly multidimensional dataset, which could make it challenging to interpret findings without clear methods for managing these complexities.\n##Jobs NYC Postings https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-jobs This dataset includes 5347 rows and 30 columns, it contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). It includes the posting type(internal/external), job category, salary range (from/to), posting date, residency requirement…We are able to load and clean the dataset, and I hope to address what is the requirement or description of the job which has the highest salary range. There are some potential challenges because some data are kind of messy and described in different words, like the job description/the minimum qual requirements/preferred skill, they might lead to more complex results.\n##Popular Baby Names https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/popular-baby-names There are 6 columns and 69214 rows in this data. The six columns describes the actual name, the year it was collected, the ethnicity this name belongs to, the gender that the name is used, the count of the use of that name in that year with a minimum of 10, and how it is ranked that year in that specific gender and ethnicity.\nBy description, this data is collected by Sex and Ethnicity Group Data through civil birth registration.\nI had no problem loading and performing some cleaning to the data.\nI believe that followings could be studied from that data: The preference difference in people choosing the name for the child based on their culture. By putting the names into a histogram group by ethnicity, we might see how each ethnicity has a sharper distribution and review some differences based on that. How the popularity of each individual name has changed. Instead of looking at the data based on ethnicity, looking at the data’s trends based on the years would also provide useful information on how people are changing their preferences."

    "text": "Popular baby names\n\n(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/popular-baby-names)\nThis data have 6 columns and 69214 rows in this data. The six columns describes the actual name, the year it was collected, the ethnicity this name belongs to, the gender that the name is used, the count of the use of that name in that year with a minimum of 10, and how it is ranked that year in that specific gender and ethnicity.By description, this data is collected by Sex and Ethnicity Group Data through civil birth registration. I had no problem loading and performing some cleaning to the data. I believe that followings could be studied from that data: The preference difference in people choosing the name for the child based on their culture. By putting the names into a histogram group by ethnicity, we might see how each ethnicity has a sharper distribution and review some differences based on that. How the popularity of each individual name has changed. Instead of looking at the data based on ethnicity, looking at the data’s trends based on the years would also provide useful information on how people are changing their preferences."

    "text": "Date Cleaning:\nFor our initial data cleaning, we started by selecting a subset of the data that contains key demographic and business characteristics, focusing on columns with minimal missing values to ensure a more reliable analysis. We first removed rows with significant missing data to avoid skewing our results but kept those with minor gaps for further inspection. As part of exploratory data analysis (EDA), we checked for unusual patterns, such as outliers, unexpectedly frequent or infrequent values, and relationships that align with or deviate from known trends. Below is an initial visualization showing the distribution of businesses by owner race and industry, helping us spot potential data inconsistencies or biases.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\ndata &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"dataset/cleaned_data_N_revenue.rds\"))\ndata |&gt;\n  filter(RACE_GROUP_LABEL != \"Total\",\n         NAICS2017_LABEL == \"Total for all sectors\",\n         SEX_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         ETH_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         VET_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         YEAR == 2017) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = RACE_GROUP_LABEL, y = FIRMPDEMP, fill = RACE_GROUP_LABEL), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  xlab(\"Major race for company\") +\n  ylab(\"Total amount of firms\")\n\n\n\ndata |&gt;\n  filter(RACE_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         NAICS2017_LABEL != \"Total for all sectors\",\n         SEX_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         ETH_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         VET_GROUP_LABEL == \"Total\",\n         YEAR == 2017) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = NAICS2017_LABEL, y = FIRMPDEMP, fill = NAICS2017_LABEL), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  xlab(\"Major industry for company\") +\n  ylab(\"Total amount of firms\")\n\n\n\n\nData Equity:\nThe first principle, justice, means treating everyone in our data fairly. If we’re analyzing factors like race, gender, or income, we need to make sure our data collection and analysis don’t favor one group over another. This ensures that all groups are represented equally, and the findings don’t carry any unfair bias. The second principle, respect for persons, focuses on people’s right to make their own choices. This means giving people the information they need to understand the data and allowing them the freedom to act on it. If someone has limits, like age, a disability, or difficulty with language, they deserve extra support to understand and participate fully in the process.\nTransparency is key, but our analysis might have limitations. While the data from the U.S. Census Bureau and NCSES is comprehensive and diverse, it only covers 2017- 2021, potentially missing recent trends. Though the dataset aims to be representative, some subgroups may still be underrepresented. Acknowledging these limitations ensures responsible use and accurate insights into business growth, diversity, and resource needs."

This helped us see how the population changed over time for each group. Next, we built a linear regression model to analyze how race, sex, and year influenced the total population. Finally, we used the model summary to understand which factors had the biggest impact and whether the results were statistically significant. This process combined visual exploration with statistical analysis to uncover meaningful patterns in the data.\nIn addition, to analyze the population distribution, we created a bar chart where the x-axis represented racial groups, the y-axis displayed the total population, and different colors were used to distinguish between sexes (Male and Female). This visualization provided a clear comparison of population sizes across racial groups and highlighted significant disparities, such as the much larger White population compared to other racial groups. The chart also revealed slight differences between male and female populations within each race."

    "text": "First, we decided to continue exploring other factors that can affect income, seeing how income has changed over years. Since we have not seen and analyzed this important factors.\nThe tentative thesis we decided to choose is that the condition for the minority group and the groups needing more care from are not great through the years. This could be discussed for several groups, including veteran groups and minority races, and from several aspects, including average income, employment rate, and the current revenue of firms with more groups needing help, and the change of amount of new opening business by that group. Under this paragraph is a plot of change of average income through year. From here, the condition doesn’t seem so well for minority groups. Although the average income for non-minority is having an increasing trend, it doesn’t increase as much for minority and there sure needs something to be done.
